### I've made the jump hundreds of times.

I started diving when I was 13 years old. My first day, one of the divers took
me up to the 10 Meter Platform and we walked to the edge together. An avid
roller coaster fan, I climbed the stairs confident I'd have no problem with the
height. I walked to the edge, gripping the rail, and said '__people actually _dive_ off this?__'

Though I've since made the plunge hundreds if not thousands of times, I still
feel the same sense of awe when I think about how fundamentally diving has altered
my destiny. Almost everything that makes me who I am -- my
faith, my work ethic, my propensity for perfectionism -- and every blessing I hold
dear -- my Princeton education, my loving family and lifelong friends, my
incredible wife -- came to me, either directly or indirectly, through the sport of
diving.

Many of my friends in the diving community finished out their competitive careers
this past weekend, and seeing their retirement posts inspired me to write about
the sport I love. Diving changed my life. Here are some of the reasons.

* __The pain.__ Every diver, from the most novice beginner to the olympic champion,
smacks every now and then. I love a good smack because they're hilarious, and because
they force you to laugh at yourself and not take failure too seriously.

* __Overcoming fear.__ Diving is so exhilarating because it's dangerous. Learning new dives
and progressing in the sport often requires a silencing (or at least quieting) of the fears
that want to keep you glued to the board. Replacing a bad habit with a new, better one is
impossible unless you're willing to be comfortable being uncomfortable.

* __The mutual encouragement and appreciation.__ One aspect of diving that amazes me to this day
is how it's a sport where you compete _with_, not _against_, your competitors. Divers cheer for
each other at competitions and hang out on the pool deck between dives, regardless of our team identities,
because we all are competing against ourselves to do our best list of dives. That's not to say I've never
felt
<a href='javascript:void(0);'>schadenfreude<img class='hidden' src="http://media0.giphy.com/media/H315tBsDtcGCk/200.gif" /></a>
at another diver's misfortunes, but divers ultimately want everyone to do their best.

* __The physical challenge.__ Diving requires extreme flexibility, explosive strength, and
fine-tuned coordination of every part of the body. The next step is finding a small enough
speedo to show off all the hard work.

* __The intellectual challenge.__ Diving is an incredibly technical sport. As a nerd, I love
discussing new techniques with other divers and coaches to get at the 'why' underneath. It's so
satisfying to have a complicated physics principle behind a technique finally click, and to translate
that knowledge into action on the board to achieve better results.

* __The sound of a rip.__ A "rip" is the badass sound that's made when you crush a dive and rip a
hole in the water, taking the splash under with you. It's the diving equivalent of a swish in basketball.

* __The relentless pursuit of perfection.__ For better or for worse, diving has cultivated my perfectionism
from a mere sapling into a weathered oak. No matter how great a dive was, no matter how proficient the technique,
I knew I could always do something better. Diving freed me from perfection's paralytic grip, though, because I
learned to iron out the imperfections that I could, and live with the ones I couldn't. You don't have to be
perfect to win, just less imperfect than your competition.

* __The feeling of a good gainer.__ Both the videos in this post are gainers. One is good, the other is not quite as good.
There's no feeling like the feeling of a good gainer. The board launches you up into the air, your legs fly up into your chest,
the somersaults are effortless, your legs straighten out and you rip through the water hard and fast.

I often joke that diving is one of my three great loves, alongside God and KP (#wife). But it really is. It's like
oxygen to a flame, the more it gets, the more it wants. For me, diving has been a great exercise in pursuing
passion for passion's sake. People _do_ actually dive off that thing. I was one of them, and I'm better for it.
